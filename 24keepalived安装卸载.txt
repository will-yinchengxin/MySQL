二. Keepalived工具安装
    2.1 安装 keepalived 需要用到 openssl

    方式一 yum安装:
    [root@localhost ~]# yum install -y curl gcc openssl-devel libnl3-devel net-snmp-devel
    [root@localhost ~]# yum install epel-release -y
    [root@localhost keepalived]#yum install keepalived -y  #通过yum直接安装
    初始化及启动
    [root@localhost ~]# systemctl start keepalived   //启动 keepalived
    [root@localhost ~]# systemctl stop keepalived   //关闭 keepalived
    [root@localhost ~]# systemctl enable keepalived  //加入开机启动 keepalived
    [root@localhost ~]# systemctl restart keepalived  //重新启动 keepalived
    [root@localhost ~]# systemctl status keepalived   //查看 keepalived 状态

    快速卸载
    [root@localhost ~]# rpm -e keepalived

    配置文件路径为/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf


    方式二 源码包安装:
    [root@localhost keepalived]# yum install gcc gcc-c++ openssl openssl-devel
    [root@localhost home]# wget -q https://www.keepalived.org/software/keepalived-1.2.18.tar.gz

    解压Keepalived并安装
    [root@localhost home]# tar -zxvf keepalived-1.2.18.tar.gz
    [root@localhost home]# cd keepalived-1.2.18
    [root@localhost keepalived-1.2.18]# ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/keepalived
    [root@localhost keepalived-1.2.18]# make && make install

    将 keepalived 安装成 Linux 系统服务(因为没有使用 keepalived 的默认路径安装（我们使用的是/usr/local） ,安装完成之后，
    需要做一些工作 复制默认配置文件到默认路径)
    [root@localhost keepalived-1.2.18]# mkdir /etc/keepalived
    [root@localhost keepalived-1.2.18]# cp /usr/local/keepalived/etc/keepalived/keepalived.conf /etc/keepalived/

    复制 keepalived 服务脚本到默认的地址
    [root@localhost keepalived-1.2.18]# cp /usr/local/keepalived/etc/rc.d/init.d/keepalived  /etc/init.d/
    [root@localhost keepalived-1.2.18]# cp /usr/local/keepalived/etc/sysconfig/keepalived  /etc/sysconfig/
    [root@localhost keepalived-1.2.18]# ln -s /usr/local/keepalived/sbin/keepalived  /usr/sbin/

    设置 keepalived 服务开机启动
    [root@localhost keepalived-1.2.18]# chkconfig keepalived on

    此时的开关机命令
    [root@localhost etc]# service strat keepalived
    [root@localhost etc]# service stop keepalived
    [root@localhost etc]# service restrat keepalived
